Designing House Exterior Using WPF 3D

This is a house built recently. WPF 3D is used to render the exterior of the house (walls, windows, doors, roofs, balcony and fences). The geometries of walls, roof and balcony are defined in the XAML file while windows, doors, fences are defined in C# code because it is more efficient to use for loop to define them. Also, a slider representing 0-360 degrees is provided to rotate the house so that house can be viewed from different directions.
